# RISC-V 32I Microprocessor
This repository contains a set of modules creating a simulated 32bit microprocessor instantiated entirely in verilog. Simulation is executed using ModelSim-Altera. To edit the instruction set, modify the program in "ROM.v" using the RISC-V 32I instruction set.


# Features
The processor is capable of performing each RISC-V type operation, including branches and memory operations. The ALU is full fidelity and capable of addition, subtraction, bitwise operations and shift instructions.
